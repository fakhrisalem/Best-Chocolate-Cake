Brief: Design a recipe page for “CookJoy,” a fictional recipe-sharing website. The page should showcase a single recipe, titled “Best Chocolate Cake,” with sections for ingredients and step-by-step instructions. The background should be a warm cream color (#FFF5E1), and the accent color a rich chocolate brown (#6B4226) to align with the theme. Practice list styling for the ingredients and step-by-step numbers for the instructions. Requirements: Title: “Best Chocolate Cake.” Ingredients: Bullet list of ingredients such as flour, sugar, cocoa powder. Instructions: Numbered list of steps for making the cake. Typography: Headings in Georgia Bold, size 22px, body text in Arial, size 16px. Images: Add placeholder images for the final dish. Responsive Layout: Ensure ingredients and steps are clearly organized on both desktop and mobile.
